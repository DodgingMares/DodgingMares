- Yo, whats up, I'm DodgingMares.
- I’m interested in C# (currently) and C++ (later).
- I’m currently learning C#, so this profile may not post many things within the creation date.
- Already have someone to collab with. (So not currently looking for a partner).
- Discord, @MaRe#6020, DMs should be open. Feel free to DM me, I should respond within the same day, unless occupied.
- Whenever I do finally master C# I will maybe post some semi-finished stuff. I probably won't get around to finishing many things due
to helping @ThatOneCodeDev with his bot.
